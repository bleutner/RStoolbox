RStoolbox 0.1.10
=====================================
Fixes:
* fix tests for upcoming raster version

RStoolbox 0.1.9
=====================================
Fixes:
* adapt to new caret version
* fix `readEE` for new EarthExplorer formats
* corrected sign of greenness `tasseledCap` coefficient for Landsat5 TM band 1 (reported by Thomas Day)
* adapt `readMeta` and `stackMeta` to new Landsat collection 1 metadata

RStoolbox 0.1.8
=====================================
New:
* `spectralIndices()` can now apply a mask internally, e.g. to exclude cloud pixels. New arguments are: 
   `maskLayer` and `maskValue` (suggested by Andrea Hess).   
* added spectral index GNDWI   

Fixes: 
* update `readEE()` to deal with new EarthExplorer export columns (reported by Christian Bauer)

RStoolbox 0.1.7
=====================================
New:
* `spectralIndices()` has a new argument skipRefCheck, which skips the heuristic check for reflectance-like values [0,1] which is run if EVI/EVI2 are requested.
   This can be usefull if clouds with reflectance > 1.5 are part of the image.
* `superClass()` now returns the geometries which were used for validation, e.g. polygons (under $validation$geometry)
   and also the exact samples taken for validation including cell number and coordinates ($validation$validationSamples)
*  added example data-set for spectral library see ?readSLI
*  increased overall test coverage 

Changes:
* ESUN lookup tables for `radCor()` are adjusted to match current USGS reccomendations from: https://landsat.usgs.gov/esun
* `spectralIndices()` swir wavelength ranges are now defined consistently and correctly. 
   Bands formerly provided as swir1 (version <1.7.0) should now (>=1.7.0) be provided as swir2 and former swir2 as swir3 respectively (see docu). 
   The actual calculations were correct, but the naming was off. 
   
Fixes:
* fix `ggR()` and `ggRGB()` in  annotation mode (default). No image was drawn and excessive memory allocation requested (= RStudio crash) (reported by Christian Walther)
* fix `spectralIndices()` documentation for NDWI. Formula was based on McFeeters1996 but attributed to Gao1996. Now there is NDWI (McFeeters) and NDWI2 (Gao) (reported by Christian Bauer)
* `estimateHaze()` now ensures correct histogram order, which could be off when raster had to read from disk (reported by Xavier Bailleau).   
* `readMeta()` now makes concise bandnames also for Landsat Collection MTL files.
* fix `radCor()` for Landsat 4 TM (reported by Thomas Day)
* `classifyQA()` confidence layer for type='water' now correctly returns only confidence levels in [1,3] 
* enable reading ENVI plot files in ASCII mode with `readSLI()`

Deprecated:
* `spectralIndices()` index `LSWI` has been deprecated, as it is identical with the now available NDWI2.

RStoolbox 0.1.6
=====================================
Fixes:
* fix import issue: replace deprecated export from caret 

RStoolbox 0.1.5
=====================================
Changes:
* If the bandSet argument in `radCor()` is used to process only a subset of bands it will no longer return unprocessed bands along with processed bands. Instead only processed bands are returned.
* By default `superClass()` will now use dataType = 'INT2S' for classification maps to avoid issues with raster NA handling in INT1U
* Allow reading and importing from Landsat MSS MTL files with `readMeta()` and `stackMeta()` (@aszeitz, #7)

Fixes:
* fix readMeta time-stamp conversion now correctly set to GMT time (@mraraju, #12)
* radCor caused R to crash if bandSet was a single band 
* fix single RasterLayer capability for superClass
* spectralIndices now calculates *all* documented indices if specified to do so (@mej1d1, #6)
* unsuperClass predicted map now handles NAs properly
* pifMatch did not return adjusted image (@tmb3006, #13)

Deprecated:
* argument `norm` was dropped from rasterPCA, because it was effectively a duplicate of the standardized pca (spca) argument in the same function.

RStoolbox 0.1.4
=====================================
New:
* new function `validateMap()` for assessing map accuracy separately from model fitting, e.g. after majority or MMU filtering
* new function `getValidation()` to extract specific validation results of superClass objects (proposed by James Duffy)
* new spectral index NDVIc (proposed by Jeff Evans)
* new argument scaleFactor for `spectralIndices()` for calculation of EVI/EVI2 based on scaled reflectance values. 
* implemented dark object subtraction radCor(..,method='sdos') for Landsat 8 data (@BayAludra, #4)

Changes:
* superClass based on polygons now considers only pixels which have their center coordinate within a polygon  
* rasterCVA now returns angles from 0 to 360° instead of 0:45 by quadrant (reported by Martin Wegmann)
* improved dark object DN estimation based on maximum slope of the histogram in `estimateHaze` (@BayAludra, #4)

Fixes:
* superClass failed when neither valData or trainPartition was specified. regression introduced in 0.1.3 (reported by Anna Stephani)
* spectralIndices valid value range of EVI/EVI2 now [-1,1]
* radCor returned smallest integer instead of NA for some NA pixels
* fix 'sdos' for non-contiguous bands in radCor (@BayAludra, #4)


RStoolbox 0.1.3
=====================================
New:
* new logical argument `predict` for superClass. Disables prediction of full raster (validation is still conducted).
* new generic predict() function for superClass objects. Useful to separate model training and prediction. 
* new example data set (landcover training polygons) for lsat example data under /extdata/trainingPolygons.rds 

Fixes:
* fix histMatch for single layers (affected also 'ihs' pan-sharpening)
* fix superClass validation sampling for factors (character based factors could lead to wrong factor conversions and wrong validation results)
* improved handling of of training polygons with overlaps and shared borders in superClass
* improved checks and error messages for insufficient training polygons

RStoolbox 0.1.2
=====================================
New:
New model for superClass: maximum likelihood classification (model = "mlc")

Fixes:
* Restrict calculation of EVI/EVI2 to reflectance data (#3)
* Enforce valid value ranges in radCor: radiance: [0,+Inf], reflectance: [0,1]. Includes a new argument `clamp` to turn this on or off (on by default).
